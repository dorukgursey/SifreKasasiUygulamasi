## Steps To Run The App
* Before running the app, apply migrations with the code below in Packet Manager Console(In DataAccessLayer); 
```
update-database
```
* Make sure to run both WEB API and WEB MVC projects with Multiple Startup Project.

## Note:
* This project uses LocalDB of MSSQL. So project may not run in Linux Machines. I did it this way for testing and demonstration conveniency.
